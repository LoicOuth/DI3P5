# Welcome to my End-of-Year Project: Custom CMS
This repository contains the work from my end-of-year project, which aimed to create a custom Content Management System (CMS). The project is structured into several distinct parts for better organization and more effective management, each contained in a separate folder according to its functionality.

## Project Folders:
- **📁USite-Backend** : This folder houses the clean architecture C# API. This is where all the application logic is handled.

- **📁USite-Templating** : It holds a .NET Framework Web API application for generation via T4 template. This part of the project is utilized for creating new page templates and their dynamic rendering.

- **📁Frontend-CMS** : This folder houses the Angular application, which is used for web page creation. We've used NGRX for state management, SignalR for real-time communication, and Tailwind for design.

- **📁Frontend-Presentation** : This folder employs Nuxt for the site payments administration. This is the frontend of the application that end-users interact with.

- **📁USite-Documentation** : Lastly, this folder contains a VuePress with all the documentation of our project. Here you'll find technical details of each part of the project as well as guides on how to use and contribute to each component.

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository serves as a showcase of the kind of projects I'm capable of handling. It's a reflection of my skills in backend and frontend development, as well as my understanding of modern development techniques and tools. The code, architecture, and design patterns used herein serve to illustrate my technical proficiency and practical experience.
For any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. I hope you find this project helpful and interesting!
